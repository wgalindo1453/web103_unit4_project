# WEB103 Project 4 - *Bolt Bucket*

Submitted by: **William Galindo**

About this web app: **Bolt Bucket is a custom car personalizer that lets users build their dream car by choosing exterior color, wheels, engine, interior, and spoiler options. The app shows a live visual preview and dynamic price as options change, saves builds to a PostgreSQL database, and supports viewing, editing, and deleting saved cars.**

Time spent: **10** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API.**
- [x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured `CustomItem` table.**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a view of your Render dashboard demonstrating that your Postgres database is available**
  - [x]  **NOTE: Your walkthrough added to the README must include a demonstration of your table contents. Use the psql command 'SELECT * FROM tablename;' to display your table contents.**
- [x] **Users can view **multiple** features of the `CustomItem` (e.g. car) they can customize, (e.g. wheels, exterior, etc.)**
- [x] **Each customizable feature has multiple options to choose from (e.g. exterior could be red, blue, black, etc.)**
- [x] **On selecting each option, the displayed visual icon for the `CustomItem` updates to match the option the user chose.**
- [x] **The price of the `CustomItem` (e.g. car) changes dynamically as different options are selected *OR* The app displays the total price of all features.**
- [x] **The visual interface changes in response to at least one customizable feature.**
- [x] **The user can submit their choices to save the item to the list of created `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **If a user submits a feature combo that is impossible, they should receive an appropriate error message and the item should not be saved to the database.**
- [x] **Users can view a list of all submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can edit a submitted `CustomItem` from the list view of submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can delete a submitted `CustomItem` from the list view of submitted `CustomItem`s.**
- [x] **Users can update or delete `CustomItem`s that have been created from the detail page.**


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Selecting particular options prevents incompatible options from being selected even before form submission

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Shared `CarForm` component used for both create and edit pages
- [x] Live car preview with exterior color, wheel rim styling, and spoiler visuals
- [x] Server-side validation that mirrors client-side combo rules
- [x] React Router navigation with edit/delete actions on list and detail pages

## Notes

The app stores custom cars in a PostgreSQL `cars` table hosted on Render. Impossible combinations (electric engine + racing spoiler, off-road wheels + racing spoiler) are blocked in the UI and rejected by the API with an error message.

The walkthrough GIF includes the Render dashboard showing the active Postgres database and a `SELECT * FROM cars;` query demonstrating saved table contents.
